Welcome to my Components repository. This project serves as a centralized, organized archive for various emulation components, translation layers, and custom drivers, making them easily accessible for testing and deployment.

📦 Included Components
This repository hosts a growing collection of essential emulation tools, including but not limited to:

* Box64 & WOWBox64
* DXVK & VKD3D
* FEXCore
* Proton & Wine
* Custom GPU Drivers

🧪 Testing & Hardware Focus
This repository contains both stable releases and experimental (alpha/beta) builds currently undergoing active testing.

Hardware Optimization: Certain items hosted here—specifically custom graphics drivers—are targeted and optimized for the Adreno 8xx architecture, including the Adreno 840.

🚀 Development Roadmap
This project is in active development. Ongoing work will heavily focus on creating and integrating performance modifications for various rendering and translation components, starting with targeted Driver and DXVK optimizations.
